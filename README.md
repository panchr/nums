Nums
=========================

A Python package that provides number-theory and other numerical applications

nums is an extension package written in Python (compatible with versions 2.7 and 3.3).
It provides supplemental classes and functions that can be used for any purpose.

Package contents include:
	bases.py - internal classes and functions (not meant to be imported directly)
	errors.py - error handling and classes (internal - do not import directly)
	Fraction.py - Fraction class, and fraction-based functions, for manipulation of fractions
	number_theory.py - functions for dealing with number theory applications
	sequences.py - functions and classes for various mathematical sequences

To install, download the appropriate installer (or archive) of the latest version.
(The archives contain a setup.py file which will install the package and all subpackages.
Run "python setup.py install" in a command-line interface to install from an archive.)
Windows users have two options: an executable installer (that also creates an uninstaller),
or a self-extracting Windows Installer.
